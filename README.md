# DDP-Week4
Developing data products: Peer graded assessment week 4

With this shiny app it is possible to compare European countries on the number COVID-19 cases and related deaths, starting from January first 2020 up to today. A week range can be selected. The first selected country is the red line in the plots and the second selected country is the blue line in the plots. The plots seen on the main panel are the COVID-19 cases and deaths respectively.

The data comes from https://opendata.ecdc.europa.eu/covid19/casedistribution/csv.
